# badavi

`badavi` is a vi-like terminal mode text editor, implemented in C and using the
[`termbox`](https://github.com/nsf/termbox) library to draw to the terminal.

It's meant to be a learning exercise and fun project to hack on rather than a
serious day-to-day editor, although who knows where it'll end up.

### Building

Just run `make`. The only dependency is `termbox`, which is easy to find --
packages surely exist for your favorite OS. On OS X, `brew install termbox`
will do.

### License

MIT -- see `LICENSE` file for details.
