# badavi

`badavi` is a vi-like terminal mode text editor, implemented in C and using the
[`termbox`](https://github.com/nsf/termbox) library to draw to the terminal.

It's meant to be a learning exercise and fun project to hack on, rather than
a serious day-to-day editor.

(`badavi` is just my last name with a v instead of a w.)
